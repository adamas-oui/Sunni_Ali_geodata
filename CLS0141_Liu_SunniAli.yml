      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think that it is on the outskirts of Kabara to the east (pp.90), but the TF indicates that Tila is another name of Kabara at that time. Modern-day Tila, according to geonames.org, is in Douentza, Mali and about 220 kilometers in the south of Kabara.

      confidence: 1
      commentary: Dirma is an area in the form of polygon. Wise and Abu Taleb think that it lies between Issa-Ber and Bara-Issa, north of Lake Debo, and the name is sometimes used for the entire region of the Niger between Jenne and Timbuktu.

      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 2
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think that this refers to the village of Diankabe, in the east of Wara; however, the only place closest to "Diankabe" is Diankabou. It is in the east of Wara, but very far from it, so I am not fully confident.

      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think that this is a village on the left bank of the Niger, facing Wara, but I cannot find it anywhere.

      commentary: After taking over Direi, Sunni Ali travelled north to Kobi.

      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 9
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 2
      commentary: According to the text, it should locate between Direi and Bambara. Wise and Abu Taleb think that it can refer to Kobi, Kobe, or Kebbi. This specific Kobe is what I can find at the moment and the most plausible.
  - title: Arguma

      coordinates:

      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: This place does not exist in modern gazetteer. Wise and Abu Taleb think this place refers to the settlement of the Yatenga, whose coordinates are 13.581359, -2.348888, in the country of Burkina Faso.
  - title: Kutte
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/2454399/kounti.html

      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: This a place where Sunni Ali performed a prayer before his next expedition. I cannot find any places with the name Kutte or Koutte. Wise and Abu Taleb think that this place is on the right bank of the river Bani and not far from Jenne. I think Kounti is plausible because: 1)it is situated close to the river Bani, although it is on the left bank. 2) it is close to Sunni Ali's next destination Kounia. 3)it is close to Jenne. 4)it has the name that sounds the closes to Kutte among all the other places that share the previous three features.
  - title: Kounia

      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 4
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 1
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think that this place is the central location of Kunari on the right bank of the river Bani and upstream of Mopti. Today it is called Kouna. It is in the north of Sunni Ali's previous stop Kutte (Kounti).

      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 3
      commentary: I cannot find any place relevant to this place. Wise and Abu Taleb think this is probably a settlement in the region around Bandiagara, whose coordinates I put in this entry.

      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this is a village situated between Bandiagara and Douentza.

      otherNames: Fakara
      ifPolygon: False

      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 3
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this could refer to Fakara, whose coordinates I put in this entry; however, Fakara is quite distant from Sunni Ali's last stop in Bandiagara, and the text does not tell us why he travelled there.
  - title: Kikere
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/2455280/kikara.html
    data: 
      otherNames: Kikera, Kikara
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates: 15.21079, -2.74825
      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 3
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 1
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this refers to Kikara in the north of Douentza. This is very plausible because in Kikara, Sunni Ali enslaved the inhabitants of Tondi, which is in the east of Kikara, a rocky and mountainous reigion.
  - title: Sura-Bantamba

      confidence: 3
      commentary: According to Wise and Abu Taleb, this refers either to a country situated in Malli or a road to Timbuktu or simply to the north.
  - title: Mansura

      coordinates:
      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 3
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this could be Mansur, a small village located on the outskirts of Gao. I cannot find any place with either name.
  - title: Azauat
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/2460837/azaouad.html
    data: 
      otherNames: Azauad, Azaouad
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates: 18.54778, -2.33417
      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 2
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this is probably Azauat or Azauad, a Saharan region that borders the northern part of the Niger. The coordinates I give here and believe to be plausible are of Azaouad, which is in the north of Gao and very close to the Saharan region. 
  - title: Tasgo

      confidence: 3
      commentary: This place (or Tasko) is unfound. Wise and Abu Taleb are not sure if this is a settlement or province.
  - title: Nassere

      modernCountry: Burkina Faso
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 1
      commentary: According to the texts, Nassere is a town in the land of the Mossi, which is modern-day Burkina Faso. Wise and Abu Taleb comment that this is where Nassere, the emperor of Yatenga, used to reside.
  - title: Lolo
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/6807090/lolo.html
    data: 
      otherNames: Laolo
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates: 13.0166, 9.1858
      modernCountry: Niger
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 2
      commentary: According to the texts, Lolo should be situated along the Niger. Wise and Abu Taleb think this place should be pronounced as Laolo based on manuscript C, but I cannot find any places with this name in the area. They also think this place is on the Niger downstream of Dendi. Because Dendi is an area that covers some lands of three countries: Niger, Nigeria, and Benin, I think the coordinates that I give here are plausible. However, GeoNames has three places that are named Lolo in Niger that are very close to each other. I am not completely confident that this is the Lolo mentioned in the texts.
  - title: Barkona
    type: settlement
    url: 
    data: 
      otherNames:
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates:
      modernCountry: Burkina Faso
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 3
      commentary: This is where the royal residence of the Mossi-koi located, so it should be in Burkina Faso. Wise and Abu Taleb also agree that this is a settlement of Yatenga. However, I cannot find any place with a similar name in the area. What can be sure is it is located in modern-day Burkina Faso, probably close to Yatenga and Sissamba.
  - title: Moli
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/6858493/moli.html
    data: 
      otherNames: Moli
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates: 13.3363, 2.2942
      modernCountry: Niger
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 2
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this probably refers to a Mossi village. According to the texts, Sunni Ali was travelling from the land of Mossi to Kikere and this Moli given is on the route. It is still within Dendi.
  - title: Numa
    type: settlement
    url: 
    data: 
      otherNames: Guma, Kuma
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates:
      modernCountry: 
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: This is not a place on the route of Sunni Ali's campaign, but a dwelling place of Dendi-fari Afumba. Therefore, it is located in Dendi. Wise and Abu Taleb think that this settlement could be Kuma or Guma. Guma, a village very close to Sarafere, is not very likely, because it is beyond the area of Dendi. This cannot be Nunma in Nigeria because of the distance. 
  - title: Dendi
    type: province
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendi_(province)
    data: 
      otherNames:
      ifPolygon: True
      coordinates:
      modernCountry: Niger, Mali, Nigeria
      frequency: 4
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 1
      commentary: This is an area very frequented by Sunni Ali.
  - title: Jenne
    type: settlement
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djenn%C3%A9
    data: 
      otherNames: Djenne
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates: 13.90608, -4.55332
      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 30
      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 1
      commentary: Sunni Ali launched a war with the people of Jenne twice, but the texts fail to give a reason.
  - title: Diaku
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/2458748/diohou.html
    data: 
      otherNames: Diohou
      ifPolygon: False
      coordinates: 14.13811, -4.92857
      modernCountry: 
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: Why do the texts indicate that Sunni Ali stayed in Diaku but performed prayers in Kanao? I assume these two places are quite close to each other. Since Sunni Ali just finished a war in Jenne, I was looking for places close to Jenne. Diohou is in the west of Jenne, and the most likely place I can find.
  - title: Kanao
    type: settlement
    url: https://www.geonames.org/2455779/kana.html
    data: 
      otherNames: Kana, Kano

      modernCountry: 
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: There are many Kano, Kana in Mali, but this particular one is close to Diohou and Jenne (east of Jenne), and the most likely one that I reckon.
  - title: Kadyibi

      commentary: Even with fuzzy search on GeoNames, I cannot locate this place. The texts fail to give any information regarding it.

      coordinates: 16.08751, -3.15194
      frequency: 1
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: According to the texts, after Sunni Ali stayed at Diarka and performed prayers at Manti, he headed back towards the river. Since his previous stops are hard to locate, this Manti probably should not be close to the river. However, I cannot locate it with the little knowledge I have from the texts. Mati could be plausible because of its closeness with Gao, his next destination.
  - title: Yatolo

      confidence: 3
      commentary: This place is unfound. According to the texts, it should be between Moli and Gao, but I cannot find any places who sound simiar to this place. Wise and Abu Taleb are completely silent about the places where Sunni Ali stayed and performed prayers in this section.

      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 3
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 1
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb point out that Biru is the Sudanese name for Walata.

      ifCampaign: True
      confidence: 3
      commentary: Wise and Abu Taleb think this place refers to either Sila or Sela in the valley of the Niger. While I cannot locate neither of them based on their commentary, I disagree with their statement and propose that this place should be located near Biru.
  - title: Sama
    type: settlement
    url: 14.92525, -3.89677
    data: 
      otherNames: Same, Samo
      ifPolygon: False

      modernCountry: Mali
      frequency: 5
      ifCampaign: False
      confidence: 3
      commentary: This is either the Sama in Mopti or that in Segou. The url and coordinates are of that in Mopti. Sama in Segou is https://www.geonames.org/2451869/sama.html. What can be sure is Sunni Ali travelled north after staying in Sama in his pursuit of Mossi-koi.
